Student Detail System is based on a concept to generate and maintain details of the students with their reports. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through login system to get access, then only he/she can use all the features of the system which includes Creating, Removing, Modifying, Searching, Viewing student records and another one is Report Card feature.

Talking about the features of Student Detail Management System, while creating student’s record he/she has to provide the roll number, student name, name, total marks in physics, chemistry, maths, English, and computer science out of 100. Under this menu, he/she can also modify student details if needed. While searching student’s record from existing database, he/she can get all the required details of the respective student. Deleting a student record is much easy here, just by entering Roll number the record is erased from the system. The other feature i.e Student’s report card display’s student name with roll number, total marks with percentage and Grade.
